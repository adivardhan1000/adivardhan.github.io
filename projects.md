## Software Development Projects

### Library Management System
**Project done under ArTech Innovations to develop a library management system to help transition schools to an online medium.**
Django based webapp.

### Automation Scripts
**Creating a list of Automation programs here to simplify daily tasks**
I started off with writing a simple script for joining a Google Meet on a fixed schedule. Well, once you
**createYourOwnTask - I str**

### Mini-projects on Python:
**Predicting House Prices with Regression using TensorFlow**
**Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow**
**First Chatbot with Rasa and Python**
**DNA Translation**

## Electronics and IoT Projects

### GSM Based Home Automation
**This project was tested using Proteus and Implemented on a stripped down version of Arduino using Atmega328P.**
Sim900D module was used as GSM Module.
