    <p>Hello, I am Adivardhan Maheshwari. This is my personal website. I've decided to remove all analytics as I value
      the privacy of my visitors. However, I appreciate knowing when someone has visited my website. So, I'm working on
      adding a 'like' button that will act as a simple counter. This will only be visible to YOU and if you choose to
      click it, I will know someone out there visited my site. Stay tuned for the update!</p>

    <p><em style="font-size: 15px;">(Sept, 2022-present)</em><br>I am pursuing my Masters in Informaton Systems Security
      Engineering at Concordia University. <br>In the past few
      months, I have been exposed to a wide-set of tools used for security and privacy analysis not limited to
      Burp-Suite, MITM proxy, jadX, GenyMotion, Triage, Mob-SF, wireshark.</p>

    <p><em style="font-size: 15px;">(Jan, 2021-Aug, 2022)</em><br>Before starting my Masters, I worked as a Full-Stack
      Developer at Principal Global Services, India. I got great hands-on expereince on a wide set of tools and
      technologies like VueJS, JAVA, SQL, AWS, CI/CD, Github Actions, Sentry, Pagerduty and many more. This gave me an
      holistic understanding of the products are developed and integrated with other products and technologies and
      everything around it.<br>

      My main job-role revolved around developing features in VueJS but it was not limited to just that. This job was my
      first time for many dev things. <br>

      I also had the opportunity to work on a centralized customizable Github Actions process that would be called up by
      individual repositories. I also had an opportunity to setup alarms in Github actions that would send alarms and
      notifications to seperate MS Teams channels as per defined requirement. Great hands-on exercise to actaully
      understand APIs.

      I worked as a code owner for a couple of repositories. This gave me an amazing opportunity to work with PRs,
      maintain repos, clean-up issues and actively get acquainted with code in different repos. <br>

      Well, I couldn't find work to put my Python skills to use so I found opportunies where I could use them. I wrote
      an automation script(in Python) that drastically reduced the manual effort by 95% when performing database
      procedures
      clean-up. <br>

      I also had an amazing opportunity to participate in <a
        hre="https://technology.principal.com/blog/cloudathon-success-stories">Principal AWS cloudathon</a> where we
      developed a system which redacts Personally
      Identifiable Information on-the-fly whenever new data is uploaded to S3 bucket. This gave me exposure to using
      various AWS products(EC2, Lambda, AthenaDB, S3, AWS CLI, Cloud 9) and linking them. (Noob tip: Use cloud 9 when
      deploying code and running scripts and don't want to deal with network restrictions.) Guess what - Most of it was
      in Python cuz why not!(and also because it was a POC) :) <br>
