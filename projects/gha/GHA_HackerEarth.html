India is a country with one of the biggest population. It is a developing nation and is shifting towards technology slowly. Nature is being affected by this changing landscape. We see cities like Delhi, where a clear sky is like a Day of Warmth in Antarctica. Pollution has been our problem since generation, but this is high time we put a check on it. One of the major producer of pollution is generation of electricity.   <br /></h4>

We have exsisting smart solutions but not limited to Google Home, Amazon Alexa and so on. One thing that strikes me the most is the affordability. Aisan contries are still developiing and the installation charges as well monthly recuring charges alone for operating these devices are high. Moreover smart devices which can be operated using these devices are very expensive at least.</h4>

An average household consumes 200-300 units per month. Everyday, cummulative 2/3 hours of appliances (considering average consumtion of 50watts) are operated for no use. considering 150 watts of electricity being wasted per day, it will be 4500 watts(i.e. merely 4.5kW) Consider a population size of let’s say 1lakh out of 1.5lakh who aren’t aware of smart appliances or just find them two expensive to buy, su 4.5*100000 = 450000kW = 450mW. Where do you think this electricity comes from? Most of it directly from burning coal.  <br /></h4>

At the circuit we use the master-slave configuration. The GSM module/wifi-module whichever the user choose needs to be connected only at the master controller. All the slave modules are connected using RF module. The data received by either GSM Module/wifi-module is sent serially to the master controller. It checks each digit serially. Consider an example: <strong><em>#Am00100A</em></strong> Here, # is the unique character that can be used to recognize if the data is garbage or useful. The second character ‘m’ represents master. ‘001’ stands for the numbered controller. In the case of master it will always be ‘001’. but in case of slaves, there can be a total of 128 modules. The next ‘0’ defines the pin number the device is interfaced with and the next digit represents ‘0’ for ‘OFF’ and ‘1’ for ‘ON’. The last character ‘A’ is similar to the first character ‘#’ to mark the end.</h4>

Instead of making the controller complicated with ‘n’ number of features, it will make it more expensive as it will require more memory and supporting devices. Coming back to the application, we can set up the correct brand and make model of a device. When ever we choose to ON/OFF the devices, we simple press ON/OFF but on the inside, the application will send the data in the spedific format that will define the values given to the IR blaster. Similarly, we can interface devices.</h4>

It can be implemented at home, offices, warehouses or any other place for that matter. There is no requirement for any new appliances. It can work on exsisting infrastructure at a minimal installation cost. There won’t be any need to change the code to add a new appliance.
