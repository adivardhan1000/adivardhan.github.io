# Electronics based Projects
> ## <u>GSM Based Home Automation</u>
> ### This project was tested using Proteus and Implemented on a stripped down version of Arduino using Atmega328P. <br> Sim900D module was used as GSM Module <br>
>> ### [GSM Based Home Automation Hackerearth Hackathon submission](/projects/gha/GHA_HackerEarth)
>> ### [GSM Based Home Automation Report](/projects/gha/GHA_report)

> ## <u>Wireless PS2 Remote Controlled 2WD 3 Wheel Robot Car</u>
> ### This was my first complete projects which involved programming Arduino Uno to take commands from a PS2 Controller and drive a robot car.
>> ### [PS2 Remote Controlled 2WD 3 Wheel Robot Car](/projects/uno_ps2_wireless_robotcar)

> ## <u>Embedded programming:</u>
> ### Performed various  simulations  and  implementations  including  interfacing  of  various  IO  devices (Keypad, LCD, Stepper-motor) on uC 8051’s RISC architecture and on uP 8085’s CISC architecture
