Hello, I am Adivardhan Maheshwari. This is my personal website. I've decided to remove all analytics as I value the privacy of my visitors. However, I appreciate knowing when someone has visited my website. So, I'm working on adding a 'like' button that will act as a simple counter. This will only be visible to YOU and if you choose to click it, I will know someone out there visited my site. Stay tuned for the update!

I am pursuing my Masters in Informaton Systems Security Engineering at Concordia University.
In the past few months, I have been exposed to a wide-set of tools used for security and privacy analysis not limited to Burp-Suite, MITM proxy, jadX, GenyMotion, Triage, Mob-SF, wireshark.

Before starting my Masters, I worked as a Full-Stack Developer at Principal Global Services, India. I got great hands-on expereince on a wide set of tools and technologies like VueJS, JAVA, SQL, AWS, CI/CD, Github Actions, Sentry, Pagerduty and many more. This gave me an holistic understanding of the products are developed and integrated with other products and technologies and everything around it.
My main job-role revolved around developing features in VueJS but it was not limited to just that. This job was my first time for many dev things.
I also had the opportunity to work on a centralized customizable Github Actions process that would be called up by individual repositories. I also had an opportunity to setup alarms in Github actions that would send alarms and notifications to seperate MS Teams channels as per defined requirement. Great hands-on exercise to actaully understand APIs. I worked as a code owner for a couple of repositories. This gave me an amazing opportunity to work with PRs, maintain repos, clean-up issues and actively get acquainted with code in different repos.
Well, I couldn't find work to put my Python skills to use so I found opportunies where I could use them. I wrote an automation script(in Python) that drastically reduced the manual effort by 95% when performing database procedures clean-up.
I also had an amazing opportunity to participate in Principal AWS cloudathon where we developed a system which redacts Personally Identifiable Information on-the-fly whenever new data is uploaded to S3 bucket. This gave me exposure to using various AWS products(EC2, Lambda, AthenaDB, S3, AWS CLI, Cloud 9) and linking them. (Noob tip: Use cloud 9 when deploying code and running scripts and don't want to deal with network restrictions.) Guess what - Most of it was in Python cuz why not!(and also because it was a POC) :)

I have been teaching students various topics related to computer science. This included pair programming, assignment and projects, and also helping them with their doubts. I have taught students from various backgrounds and age groups. Some structed courses include AP Computer Science Principles, Python Bootcamp, Introduction to Data Science and Manipulation, Automation using Programming, Introduction to various programming languages, black programming using code.org, Full-stack development and game development. Feedback from students and parents have equally satisfactoy. I continue to teach as the time permits and feel free to get in touch with me if you're interested in learning something.
